We'll assign each team a number. Your team number determines which ten observations from the testing set you'll predict (Round 1) and vote on (Round 2).

Team #: _____________  

# Round 1: Predict

Pick a random seed to use: _____________  
*Shh. Don't tell any of your teammates.* 

Use the `get_boot_votes()` function provided to:

+ build a single classification tree, 
+ train it with one bootstrapped sample, and 
+ predict your 10 observations from the testing set. 

Your output will look like this. Use it to fill in the table on the back of this page.

```{r}
get_boot_votes(seed = 0, team = 2020)
```

What was your bootstrapped tree's overall accuracy?

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ensembling.jpeg")
```




# Round 2: Vote!

Now, as a team, form a voting committee. You have your tree's votes for those 10 observations already filled in the table above. Your job now is to tally up the number of votes for `Remote / Not Remote` across all team members' trees. Fill in the second half of the table with your team.

What was your team's overall accuracy, across each members' bootstrapped trees?
