While Hypothesis Testing and Machine Learning are beginning to overlap, the subjects began as two very distinct fields. Understanding these initial differences will help you better understand Machine Learningâ€”especially if you are coming to Machine Learning from a background in Statistics or Science.

# Hypothesis Testing

Statistical models were originally an extension of _hypothesis testing_. With statistical models, you use a model to test the __________________ in the model.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}

```


When using models to test hypotheses, the hypothesis dictates

1. 
2. 
3.

Although you end up with a fitted model when you do hypothesis testing, the fitted model is of  **circle one:** (utmost / secondary) importance to the task at hand, which is to _________________________.



# Machine Learning

Machine Learning is an extension of computer science. In Machine Learning, you want to develop an algorithm that will allow a computer to make _______________________. When we do Machine Learning, we're **circle one:** (picky, not picky) about which data or model we use, so long as our algorithm has a low ___________________. This isn't to say anything goes; some data sets can not yield a low ___________________.

Machine Learners tend to use the same models as hypothesis testers because:

In Machine Learning, the fitted model (i.e. the trained model) is of **circle one:** (utmost / secondary) importance because you use it to generate new predictions.
