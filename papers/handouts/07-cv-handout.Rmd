1. Fill in the blanks in the diagram below to label the steps of cross-validation.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cv-blanks.jpeg")
```

3. Why does it make more sense to split our data into several different training and testing sets and average the results (i.e. to cross-validate) than to use a single training/testing set split?

4. The tidyverse code on the right is implementing a cross-validation strategy to evaluate a model with the ames data. Draw a line from each section of code on the right to the word in the diagram on the left that it is associated with. Can you tell what the code does?
