# Your Turn 1

Write a pipe that creates a learner that uses `lm()` to fit a linear regression. Save it as `lm_spec` and look at the object. What does it return?

```{r}
lm_spec <- 
   linear_reg() %>% # Pick linear regression
   set_engine(engine = "lm") # set engine
lm_spec
```

# Your Turn 2

Double check. Does

```{r}
lm_fit <- fit_data(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, model = lm_spec, data = ames)
lm_fit
```

give the same results as

```{r}
lm(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, data = ames)
```


# Your Turn 3

Fill in the blanks. Use `predict()` to

1. Use your linear model to predict sale prices; save the tibble as `price_pred`  
1. Add a pipe and use `mutate()` to add a column with the observed sale prices; name it `truth`

```{r}
lm_fit <- fit_data(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, 
                   model = lm_spec, 
                   data = ames)

price_pred <- ________ %>% 
  predict(new_data = ________) %>% 
  ________

price_pred
```

```{r}
lm_fit <- fit_data(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, 
                   model = lm_spec, 
                   data = ames)

price_pred <- lm_fit %>% 
  predict(new_data = ames) %>% 
  mutate(truth = ames$Sale_Price)

price_pred
```



# Your Turn 4

In your teams, decide which model:

1. Has the smallest residuals  
2. Will have lower prediction error. Why?  


# Your Turn 5

Fill in the blanks. 

Use `initial_split()`, `training()`, `testing()`, `lm()` and `rmse()` to:

1. Split **ames** into training and test sets. Save the rsplit!

2. Extract the training data. Fit a linear model to it. Save the model!

3. Measure the RMSE of your linear model with your test set.  

Keep `set.seed(100)` at the start of your code.

*Hint: Be sure to remove every `_` before running the code!*

```{r}
set.seed(100) # Important!

ames_split  <- ________
ames_train  <- ________
ames_test   <- ________

lm_fit      <- fit_data(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, 
                        model = lm_spec, 
                        data = ________)

price_pred  <- ________ %>% 
  predict(new_data = ________) %>% 
  mutate(price_truth = ________)

rmse(________, truth = ________, estimate = ________)
```

```{r}
set.seed(100) # Important!

ames_split  <- initial_split(ames)
ames_train  <- training(ames_split)
ames_test   <- testing(ames_split)

lm_fit      <- fit_data(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, 
                        model = lm_spec, 
                        data = ames_train)

price_pred  <- lm_fit %>% 
  predict(new_data = ames_test) %>% 
  mutate(price_truth = ames_test$Sale_Price)

rmse(price_pred, truth = price_truth, estimate = .pred)
```


# Your Turn 6

Rewrite your code from the previous exercise using `fit_split()` and `collect_metrics()` to:

1. Split **ames** into training and test sets. Save the rsplit!

2. Fit a linear model to the training set, then use the model to predict new observations from the test set.

3. Extract the rmse- is it the same as what we just calculated in our previous exercise `r round(rmse_test, 0)`?

Keep `set.seed(100)` at the start of your code.

```{r}
set.seed(100) # Important!

ames_split  <- initial_split(ames)
ames_train  <- training(ames_split)
ames_test   <- testing(ames_split)

lm_fit      <- fit_data(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, 
                        model = lm_spec, 
                        data = ames_train)

price_pred  <- lm_fit %>% 
  predict(new_data = ames_test) %>% 
  mutate(price_truth = ames_test$Sale_Price)

rmse(price_pred, truth = price_truth, estimate = .pred)
```


```{r}
set.seed(100) # Important!

ames_split <- initial_split(ames)

lm_split <- fit_split(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, 
                      model = lm_spec, 
                      split = ames_split)

lm_split %>% 
  collect_metrics()
```


# Your Turn 7

Write a pipe to create a model that uses the rpart package to fit a regression tree. Use `fit_split()` and `collect_metrics()` to compare the RMSE here to one using the linear model for the same formula- which is better?

*Hint: you'll need https://tidymodels.github.io/parsnip/articles/articles/Models.html*

```{r}
rt_spec <- 
  __________ %>%          
  __________ %>% 
  __________

set.seed(100) # Important!
__________(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, 
          model = __________, 
          split = __________) %>% 
  __________
```

```{r}
rt_spec <- 
  decision_tree() %>%          
  set_engine(engine = "rpart") %>% 
  set_mode("regression")

set.seed(100) # Important!
fit_split(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, 
          model = rt_spec, 
          split = ames_split) %>% 
  collect_metrics()
```



# Your Turn 11

Write *another* pipe to create a model that uses the kknn package to fit a K nearest neighbors model. Use `fit_split()` and `collect_metrics()` to compare the RMSE here to our other models with the same formula- which is better?

*Hint: you'll need https://tidymodels.github.io/parsnip/articles/articles/Models.html*

```{r}
knn_spec <- 
  nearest_neighbor() %>%          
  set_engine(engine = "kknn") %>% 
  set_mode("regression")

set.seed(100) # Important!
fit_split(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, 
          model = rt_spec, 
          split = ames_split) %>% 
  collect_metrics()
```
